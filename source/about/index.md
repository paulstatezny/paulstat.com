### About Paul

#### Work

I am a developer at [Synapse Studios](http://synapsestudios.com) since June 2013. I previously managed [Arizona Christian University](http://arizonachristian.edu)'s web presence from July 2011 to June 2013. I have a passion for the craft of web development.

#### Life

Like many programmers, I play a little bit of music. I love all sorts of music, from classical to jazz to heavy rock and beyond. My two years in my high school jazz band were a blast! In 2009 I produced a rock album for a band in which I played bass, The Great Exchange. (Looks like it's no longer on iTunes though. Boo!)

I am a Christian. I love talking with people about things of spiritual nature. If you have any questions about the Bible, God or Jesus I'd love to chat with you!

I live in the Phoenix metropolitan area with my wife and daughter.
