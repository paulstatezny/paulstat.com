In this short read, Callum Macrae exposes budding JavaScript programmers to the nuts and bolts of JavaScript and jQuery. The book is targeted at programmers who have used jQuery but don't feel comfortable with “vanilla JavaScript.” (Macrae assumes, appropriately, that a lot of this audience is newer to programming in general.)

Learning from jQuery is great for complete JavaScript beginners, but also enlightening for people like me – experienced programmers who aren't yet “seasoned” with JavaScript. Some very practical items I had never heard of: the **with** keyword, **for … in** loops, double negation (!!), and *function scope*.

A lot of the book is spent demonstrating how to recreate parts of jQuery. Macrae provides full-fledged examples of event handling wrappers (chapter 1), jQuery-like element selectors (chapter 3), and AJAX wrappers (chapter 4). It was a bit tedious reading through these, because he includes cross-browser support in his examples. (Which just makes you want to use jQuery rather than reinventing the wheel.) Still, I came away with a bigger appreciation for jQuery.

I do have a few criticisms. I cringed whenever Macrae referred to **singleton** as a legitimate design pattern, without any warnings or qualifications. (Singleton can be really bad; many call it an antipattern.) He also neglects the PUT and DELETE methods in the AJAX chapter, but those are probably outside the scope of the book.

Macrae is also a great “beginner's tour guide” – highlighting a lot of JavaScript culture, and not just the language itself. Appendix B references tools like GitHub and JSFiddle. He even highlights MDN, which is great for the JS newbie who is probably running into a lot of W3Schools (a horrible, inaccurate tutorial website) on Google.

Overall, I have to say this is an excellent read. Some sections are targeted at complete programming newbies, but Learning from jQuery will help intermediate JavaScript programmers to solidify their understanding of the language.
